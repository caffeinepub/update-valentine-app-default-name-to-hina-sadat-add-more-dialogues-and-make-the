  "summary": "REQ-1 and REQ-2 appear implemented in App.tsx (default name set to \"Hina Sadat\"; expanded No-message list). REQ-3 and REQ-4 cannot be fully verified from the provided truncated diff: the event handlers/layout changes that would prove hover is disabled, mobile single-tap doesn’t double-trigger, and small-screen overflow/bounds constraints are not visible. Diff also includes changes/additions not requested (project_state.json, and modifications related to Internet Identity/auth plus background music controls per file summary).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Change the \"No\" button behavior so it moves to a new position only when the user clicks/taps it (not on hover/proximity), and on mobile a single tap triggers a single move (no touch+click double-trigger).",
      "reason": "The diff shows a moveNoButton() helper and a larger message list, but the truncated App.tsx excerpt does not show the actual button event bindings (e.g., onClick/onPointerUp/onMouseEnter/onTouchStart) needed to confirm hover/proximity does nothing and that mobile does not double-trigger.",

        "frontend/src/App.tsx (truncated before handlers)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Ensure the main interaction layout fits comfortably on phone-sized screens without horizontal overflow; adjust button sizing/stacking as needed; keep No-button movement within visible container on small screens.",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt does not include the JSX/Tailwind classes/layout CSS that would demonstrate no horizontal overflow at ~360px and confirm the No button is constrained within the visible container area on small screens. The move bounds math is shown partially, but the truncation prevents verifying full bounds logic and responsive container sizing.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Ensure no other part of the UI still defaults to \"Ghazal\".",
      "reason": "App.tsx sets the state default to \"Hina Sadat\", but the truncated diff does not allow verifying there are no remaining \"Ghazal\" defaults elsewhere in the UI/templates.",
